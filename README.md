# SmartName

Digital desk name plate solution powered by Raspberry PI. Raspberry PI hosts signalR based ASP.Net core application that is displayed on fullscreen browser. PC companion app is a windows service that sends the availability to the SignalR service based on Windows' login/lock status changes. A fun setup used on my work desk in the Pre-COVID19 era :)
